# RNA-Seq
course of bern 
this project is for rna-seq project code, there are 7 steps for this analysis. I arleady finished first step creating my workspce named ``zwang_workspace``in th cluster, here I paste the pathway of my workspace, ```/data/courses/rnaseq/breastcancer_de/zwang_workspace```. So I will show all remaining 6 steps code in this website.
# step2 Quality checks

# (optional) dealwith the data, to clean some adapter 

#  step3  Map reads to the reference genome

# step4  Count the number of reads per gene

# step5  Exploratory data analysis

# step6  Differential expression analysis

# step7  Overrepresentation analysis
